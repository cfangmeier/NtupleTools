#List Parsing Tool

###Description
Each week thousands of datasets are produced and the list is sent to hn-cms-datasets@cern.ch.

This software takes a first pass at rejecting the datasets we obviously don't want.  The remainder have to be sorted by hand.  

###Instructions
  1. Paste the entire contents of the e-mail to a text file "week23.txt" or something.
  2. ". samples.sh week23.txt"
